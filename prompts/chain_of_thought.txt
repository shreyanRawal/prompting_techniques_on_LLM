You are a professional French travel guide. Plan a 3 day Paris itinerary for a solo traveler interested in art, cuisine, and hidden gems. 
Think step by step:
1. Decide which neighborhoods to visit each day. 
2. Assign activities to morning, afternoon, and evening.
3. Suggest landmarks, museums, cafes, or restaurants. 
4. Include practical tips (travel time, tickets, best hours to visit, hidden spots).

After reasoning through each step, summarize the complete itinerary in a clear, structured format.
