1. Criteria

Used clear, consistent scoring categories (0–5 scale each):

Relevance – Does the itinerary actually focus on art, local cuisine, and hidden gems (as asked)?

Structure & Clarity – Is it well-organized (morning/afternoon/evening), easy to follow, concise?

Creativity & Uniqueness – Does it go beyond generic suggestions, adding hidden gems, insider tips, or cultural notes?

Practicality – Includes tips (tickets, timing, safety, budget, transport)? Solo traveler–friendly?

Readability & Engagement – Is it enjoyable to read? Feels like a real guide or just a dry list?

Most concise but still rich: Few-shot (24/25) → clear, fun, easy to scan.

Strong baseline: Zero-shot (22/25) → good, but less engaging compared to others.






b) Grok LLM

Relevance: 4 (covers big museums, cuisine, but fewer “hidden gems” than Claude).

Structure: 4 (day split is clear, but sometimes just lists).

Creativity: 3 (choices are mainstream; less offbeat detail).

Practicality: 3 (few concrete tips like timing, transport).

Readability: 4 (simple, straightforward).

Total = 18/25

Grok – Few Shot

Structure: 5 (very clean, easy to follow, matches example style).

Creativity: 4 (adds quirky places like Rue des Rosiers).

Practicality: 3 (basic guidance, but lacks transport/budget tips).

Readability: 4 (pleasant, concise).

Total = 20/25

Structure: 5 (planning steps + final clear itinerary).

Creativity: 4 (mentions Musée de la Vie Romantique, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont).

Practicality: 4 (good tips on walking routes, timing, cafés).

Creativity: 5 (adds secret courtyards, quirky cafés, offbeat wine bars).

Practicality: 4 (offers etiquette + dining solo advice, but fewer transport/budget details than Claude).

Total = 24/25

Grok – Self-Consistency

Relevance: 5 (strong mix of art, food, hidden spots).

Structure: 4 (tries multiple drafts, but can feel repetitive).

Creativity: 5 (final merged version is rich in unique ideas).

Practicality: 4 (helpful tips, though less organized than Claude’s).

Readability: 4 (longer, sometimes harder to skim).

Total = 22/25

Insights

Best Grok version: Role-based (24/25) → strongest, feels authentic and exciting.

Second best: Self-consistency (22/25) → thoughtful but less concise.

Chain-of-thought (21/25) is solid but a bit heavy.

Few-shot (20/25) is clean but not as rich.

Zero-shot (18/25) is the weakest — too generic.

Comparing both models: Claude’s Role-based (25/25) edges out Grok’s Role-based (24/25), mainly because Claude adds more practical solo traveler details (transport, budget hacks, safety).
